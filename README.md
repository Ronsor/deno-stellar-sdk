# Stellar SDK for Deno

This is a patched version of the Stellar SDK distributed via cdnjs.
All I've done is allow it to be imported as an ES6 module. There are
no types yet. You'll have to figure that out yourself.

## Get Started

```js
import { StellarSdk } from '...';

console.log(StellarSdk); // use according to the documentation
```
